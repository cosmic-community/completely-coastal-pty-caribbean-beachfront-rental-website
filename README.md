About the company: We rent beachfront and coastal properties in the Caribbean side of Panama, specifically in Costa Abajo de Col√≥n, about 2.5 hours from Panama City. The location is rural and peaceful ‚Äî visitors experience authentic village life (sometimes even the neighbor's chickens wander by!). All bookings are managed through Airbnb, so the website should showcase the properties and link directly to Airbnb for reservations. Brand personality: Relaxed, tropical, authentic, welcoming, and local. Focus on tranquility, comfort, and connection to nature, while showing the charm of rural Caribbean village life. Colors: sandy beige, palm green, coral, and darker ocean blue (not crystal-clear turquoise).
